# Race of Sloths Onboarding ‚òÑÔ∏è

Race of Sloths is a GitHub bot-user that helps open-source contributors collect Sloth Points while contributing to projects on GitHub.

1. Follow your regular GitHub flow: Create a regular PR ([example](https://github.com/race-of-sloths/race-of-sloths-onboarding/pull/2))
2. Tag `@race-of-sloths` user in the description (or PR comment)
3. The user will respond to you and ask the repo maintainer to review your PR and score your PR
4. Now you are part of the Race! You are one of the Sloths (learn more about the irony behind the naming [here](https://race-of-sloths.com/about))
